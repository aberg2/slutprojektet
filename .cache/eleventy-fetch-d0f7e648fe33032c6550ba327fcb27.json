Before arriving here, visitors have a vivid image of this monument as seen in a postcard, movie, or on a keychain, yet the Eiffel Tower still manages to amaze.\r\n\r\nThis masterpiece of architectural achievement soars to a height of 324 meters. A feat of ingenuity, the structure of 18,000 iron parts is held together by 2.5 million rivets.\r\n\r\nDespite its massive weight, the Eiffel Tower has an airy lattice construction with the seeming lightness of a ballerina on point. The graceful tower is also known as the \"Iron Lady.\"  The unusual architectural form makes many people wonder why the Eiffel Tower was built in the first place. Its original raison d'être was to serve as the entrance to the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair).\r\n\r\nIn 1887, the Journal Officiel launched a competition for a tower to be exhibited at the fair. Entrepreneur Gustave Eiffel, along with architect Stephen Sauvestre and collaborating engineers, submitted the winning project.\r\n\r\nThough the tower was only meant to last for 20 years, it has become the most recognized feature of the Paris skyline. For tourists, visiting this icon is often a highlight of their trip to Paris.",

It’s the favorite color of adolescent girls, and it’s the color of fantasy and magic. It’s half-blue, half-red, and our understanding of purple lies somewhere in between the serenity of blue and the passion of red.\r\n\r\nWhat do we know about purple?\r\n\r\nPhysical Effects\r\nPurple both calms and stimulates our bodies, putting us in the right place for introspection and focused insight. It fosters creativity by awakening our senses while promoting the quiet necessary to make intuitive, insightful observations. Purple creates a harmonious balance of awareness and peace.\r\n\r\n",

            "desc": "I am a shoe fan and my best brand is Nike. My mother told me, I got my first Nike shoes when I was 5 years old. Usually, I will buy a pair of shoes every 1~2 months. So, I cannot imagine how many Nike shoes I have bought during the past 20 years. 200 pairs? Maybe.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I love Nike is very simple: I trust Nike. It is very difficult for an apparel or footwear company to build this kind of loyalty to its consumers. Nike is good at lots of things: manufacturing high quality and good-looking shoes; designing fashion or professional apparels; sponsoring lots of sports teams; and making tons of money. But where the company truly excels is its marking. There is no company doing branding like Nike. Nike dominates the sports gear industry because of their brilliant branding strategies.\r\n\r\nNike has made a wonderful impression by its outstanding advertisements. Many established companies have rather timid advertising campaigns, preferring to rest on their laurels and history of success. Nike is not one of those companies. Instead, it’s constantly tinkering, innovating and pushing the envelope to create campaigns people will talk about. Nike has never been afraid to take chances with its ad campaigns. The company makes commercials you don’t forget. For example, Nike will focus on love, impossible, greatness, future and so on.",

            "desc": "Reason 1: The Games Are Non-Stop Action\r\nOne of the best things about hockey is the action. In many sports, there are several stoppages to play that will slow the game down and lead to a lot of breaks. There is certainly action in these sports, but it is split up by the frequent breaks.\r\n\r\nIn hockey, this isn’t the case. While penalties, time outs and goals will stop the game, that’s about it. Players are moving fast, line changes happen in an instant and there is always something going on to watch.\r\n\r\nReason 2: Hockey Is Very Physical\r\nAnother thing to love about hockey is that it is a very physical game. It is full-contact, and the physicality provides players and teams another way to control the game as opposed to simply playing skillfully and with speed.\r\n\r\nAlso, while not for everyone, the fighting in hockey is certainly unique and unlike anything seen in any of the other major sports. Of course, in addition to the physicality, the game of hockey is still very skillful. Stickhandling, deking, and skating in all directions are hard skills to master.\r\n\r\nReason 3: The Toughness of The Players\r\nWhile all athletes are tough, few (if any) are as tough as hockey players. They will regularly keep playing after getting pucks to the face, sticks to the face, and body checked into the hard boards. Missing teeth, broken noses, black eyes and everything else are common to see.\r\n\r\nCompare that to other sports where players will remain on the ground for minutes after suffering a bit of contact or tripping, and the toughness of hockey players becomes evident. While playing through injury, pain and discomfort is difficult, hockey players will do it day in and day out.\r\n\r\nReason 4: The Unique Traditions\r\nTraditions and superstitions are a part of every sport. However, no sport does it like hockey. Take, for example, the unique tradition of growing playoff beards. It is a near league-wide tradition where players on all teams won’t shave throughout their teams’ playoff run.\r\n\r\nMany players may also have traditions like special handshakes with teammates or eating the same meal before every game. Some may also be very odd, such as tapping a stick a certain number of times, skating the same pattern on the ice during warm-ups.\r\n\r\nShaking hands with the opposing team after a playoff series is another tradition that I’d love to see other sports pick up on.",

            "desc": "Taste is experienced through the use of both your tongue and nose. Your tongue is coated in about 10,000 papillae (pah-pill-ah), which are the little bumps that contain your taste buds. When you place something into your mouth it instantly comes into contact with them. Taste buds are a type of nerve cell that is activated by the chemical makeup of food. These chemicals change the specific proteins in the cell walls, sending message signals to similar sensory cells, who then pass this information to your brain as the perception of taste like sweet, sour, salty, and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of taste are interesting in and of themselves. However, most of what we perceive as flavor, the taste of whatever you are eating, is actually coming from the aroma. The way a food smells. When you fire up the grill and toss food onto the red-hot grids, the Maillard Reaction occurs. The browning of whatever you’re cooking smells divine, activating the saliva ducts in your mouth, which will facilitate the transference of the chemicals that activate your taste buds. Smoking and Caramelization have a similar effect on your olfactory sense.",

Puzzled how something so sexy and powerful shares a body style with something as dorky and feeble as a Chevy Spark? Well, as with the A7 and S7 variants that the RS7 is based on, Audi bookends these sleek four-doors with a hatch for added practicality. However, the RS6 Avant wagon is cheaper and roomier. Still, with haunches this broad and a twin-turbo V-8 boasting 591 horsepower, getting noticed and going fast are the RS7's primary objectives. While its explosive thrust causes passengers to involuntarily cuss, and its sharp handling inspires the driver to smile, the hottest of hatches never feels unruly or raw. Instead, its interior exudes expensiveness, pampering riders with rich trappings and ritzy features. As a result, the premium-priced 2022 RS7 is a rapid expression of both driving enthusiasm and wealth, and it earns a spot on our Editors' Choice list.",
